You find yourself standing at the entrance of a mysterious temple hidden deep within the jungle. The air is thick with humidity, and ancient vines hang from the crumbling stone walls.

Guardian: "Who dares to disturb the sanctity of this temple? Prepare to face the consequences of your trespass!"

You swing your sword with all your might, striking the Guardian with a powerful blow!

Guardian: "No... this cannot be! You may have defeated me, but you will never uncover the true secrets of this temple!"

With the Guardian defeated, you stand victorious within the temple's depths. The path to its treasures lies open before you.

You're dead.
